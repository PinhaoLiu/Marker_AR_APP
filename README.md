# Marker AR APP

This is a simple mobile AR app that:
- Uses the phone's camera to recognize a specific image (marker) in the real world,
- Automatically places a 3D object (like a cube) on top of the recognized image,
- Opens a link (like a website or video) when the marker is detected.

It's a minimal, clean, and interactive example of how image tracking in AR works -- and it forms a great foundation for more advanced, interactive AR projects in education, marketing, and more.
